## Nihanjali's Journal

This is a log of the scrum meetings that Team Codeaholics had every week. Living in the same apartment complex, has enabled us to coordinate physical meetings quite regularly and has also greatly helped in building our team rapport.

## XP Core Values

 **Communication and Feedback**
 In our case communication was a strong point as we were all regularly communicating via Whatsapp, meeting in person either- on campus as we shared two classes together or back in our apartment building.
 Progress was quite easy to track using github and the project board. Regular meetings helped us assess where we could make appropriate changes to our APIs or to the documentation to make a more cohesive project and have seamless integration.

A discussion of our understanding of the assignment took place. We all sat together and penned down the ways we could elaborate on the requirements of the project.
