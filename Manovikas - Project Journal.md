# Manovikas' Project Journal

This journal is a log of Manovikas' scrum meetings with the Codeaholics team every week. All the members in this team were able to coordinate and conduct meetings physically. Living in the same apartment complex has enabled us to coordinate physical meetings regularly and has also greatly helped in building our team rapport.

## Ownership

I took the ownership of building the database schema and the objects in it. I was responsible for creating a database in Amazon RDS, creating tables and stored procedures. I also set up the initial boiler plate to the application and configured the database connection with the server. I worked on three modules in the application:
1. Creating a User
2. Creating an account to a user
3. Display list of accounts user holds

## XP Core Values

 **Communication and Feedback**
The core values which we considered important are Communication and Feedback. Communication was one of the strong point as we were able to regularly communicate through Whatsapp Messenger, meeting each other in person on campus and at our apartment. We were able to track our progress using Github repository and the project board. Regular meetings helped us assess where we could make appropriate changes to our APIs or to the documentation to make a more cohesive project and have seamless integration.

Due to regular communication, it was easy for us to have continuous feedback to each other. We were able to answer each other's queries and able to assess each others performance rate. We were able to provide feedback to other team member, if their module requires any improvement.

## Weekly Scrum Report

### Week1

> **Agenda**
During our initial phase of project, we worked on analyzing the requirements and elaborated them into detailed user stories and split them into tasks.
