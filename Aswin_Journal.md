# Aswin's Project Journal

This journal is a log of Aswin's scrum meetings with the Codeaholics team every week. All the members in this team were able to coordinate and conduct meetings physically. Living in the same apartment complex has enabled us to coordinate physical meetings regularly and has also greatly helped in building our team rapport.

## Ownership

I worked on the APIs to make transfers and list transactions and filter them based on the transaction type.

## XP Core Values

 **Communication and Feedback**
 
The core values which we considered important are Communication and Feedback. Communication was one of the strong point as we were able to regularly communicate through Whatsapp Messenger, meeting each other in person on campus and at our apartment. We were able to track our progress using Github repository and the project board. Regular meetings helped us assess where we could make appropriate changes to our APIs or to the documentation to make a more cohesive project and have seamless integration.


Due to regular communication, it was easy for us to have continuous feedback to each other. We were able to answer each other's queries and able to assess each others performance rate. We were able to provide feedback to other team member, if their module requires any improvement.
